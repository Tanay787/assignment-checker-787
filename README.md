# Project Overview

This codespace contains the code for a simple web application that allows users to create, edit, and delete assignments. The application is built with React and uses a MongoDB database to store the assignments.

# Features

The application has the following features:

* Users can create new assignments.
* Users can edit existing assignments.
* Users can delete assignments.
* Users can view the status of assignments.
* Users can view the remarks for assignments.

# How to Use the Application

To use the application, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The application will automatically load the assignments from the database.

To create a new assignment, click the "Create New Assignment" button. This will open a form where you can enter the assignment name, course, year, due date, and file URL.

To edit an existing assignment, click the "Edit" button next to the assignment. This will open a form where you can edit the assignment information.

To delete an assignment, click the "Delete" button next to the assignment.

To view the status of an assignment, click the "Status" button next to the assignment. This will open a modal window that displays the assignment status.

To view the remarks for an assignment, click the "Remarks" button next to the assignment. This will open a modal window that displays the assignment remarks.
